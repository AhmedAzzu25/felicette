Félicette was the first cat launched into space, on 18 October 1963. Even though she landed back on earth safely, but she was humanely killed after 2 months to save her from a bad health, and scientific research. [Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-tpmvGRoyw) a footage of the mission from the archives.

When you get a satellite imagery using this tool, imagine Félicette took the picture for you :))
